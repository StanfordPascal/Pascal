Implementation of Strings for the New Stanford Pascal Compiler

created by Bernd Oppolzer - 12.2017

**********************************************************************


A String variable in STOR looks like this:

2 Bytes Maxlength Field (<= 32767)
2 Bytes actual length
and Content Field (Maxlength Bytes)

The MAXLENGTH function can look here, but in most cases it
will not be necessary, because MAXLENGTH knows its value from
the definition at compile time. The MAXLENGTH field will not be
populated, before the variable is assigned the first time.

The MAXLENGTH field must be used, when Strings are passed as
var Parameters. In this case, the MAXLENGTH field is guaranteed
to be populated before the CUP instruction by the special P-Code
instruction VSM (set Maxlength).

A String variable on the stack look like this:

2 Bytes Maxlength Field (which is always -1 in this case)
2 Bytes actual length
and a Content Field, which is a Pointer (a Cell Number)

This is called a "String descriptor" or a "String on stack".

The Pointer in this case may point into STOR (in this case
the String descriptor points to a normal String variable
in STOR, which is loaded on the stack). Or it may point to
the String workarea, which is a special area used to hold
String expression, for example concatenations or Strings
resulting from conversions.

"Strings on stack" and especially "String expressions"
cannot be updated in place, instead every time there is an
update, a new version has to be built (new allocation
from the String space).

"Normal" String variables can be updated in place, but the
Maxlength has to be respected (of course) - see P-Code VST.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The address of a String can be passed to subroutines.
Conformant Strings (var parameters with no length specified)
are possible. Read access to such parameters works in the normal way,
and write access is done using VST x,0. Using this, length check
is done not by using the second parameter of VST (which is 0),
but by looking at the Maxlength value of the target variable.
This in turn means, that Maxlength MUST be set for var parameters.
That's why Maxlength is forced to be set on every call,
when String var parameters are involved.

P-Code instructions
===================

VLD = Load String to Stack

Format: VLD n

n = max length of Source

Stack contains addr of varchar variable
pop addr of varchar variable

if actual length of String read is not <= defined max length
as given by parameter n, then RT error "Undefined String"
(maybe: set max length of varchar variable ? for static ?)

SP - 1 := -1 / length (no Maxlength, actual length is ok)
SP     := addr of Strings (alloc from StringArea)

push 2 stack items

VLD does not copy the String to be loaded to the String workarea,
it only builds a String descriptor on the stack, which points
to the original position of the String in the String variable
in STOR

If n specifield on VLD instruction is zero, then VLD is used to
load a conformant string parameter from the parameter list.
In this case, the maxlength of the parameter is used, not the
maxlength specified in the instruction.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

VST = Store String from Stack to Memory

Format: VST x,n

x = mode (0 or 1)
n = maxLength of Target

if mode = 0:

   if n > 0:

      SP - 2 = target addr of String variable
      SP - 1 = -1 / length (String on stack)
      SP     = source addr (String on stack)

      move String from stack to target addr
      actual length of String must be less or equal than n
      Maxlength at target addr is set to n
      pop 3 stack items
      RT Error "Undefined String", if length in SP - 1 (links) is not minus 1
      RT Error "Stringsize", if actual length of source String > n

   if n = 0:

      SP - 2 = target addr of String variable
      SP - 1 = -1 / length (String on stack)
      SP     = source addr (String on stack)

      move String from stack to target addr
      actual length of String must be less or equal than Maxlength of target (!)
      pop 3 stack items
      RT Error "Undefined String", if length in SP - 1 (links) is not minus 1
      RT Error "Stringsize", if actual length of source String > Maxlength of target

   if n < 0:

      SP - 2 = target addr of String representation
      SP - 1 = -1 / length (String on stack)
      SP     = source addr (String on stack)

      move "String on stack" representation to memory (8 bytes)
      used for function results (conformant String type as function result type)
      pop 3 stack items
      stack is empty after that
      the function result is pushed to the stack by the RET instruction
      RT Error "Undefined String", if length in SP - 1 (links) is not minus 1

if mode = 1:

   if n > 0:

      SP - 2 = -1 / length (String on stack)
      SP - 1 = source addr (String on stack)
      SP     = target addr of String variable

      move String from stack to target addr
      actual length of String must be less or equal than n
      Maxlength at target addr is set to n
      (same as above, but other sequence of
      parameters on the stack)
      pop 3 stack items
      RT Error "Undefined String", if length in SP - 1 (links) is not minus 1
      RT Error "Stringsize", if actual length of source String > n

   if n = 0:

      SP - 2 = -1 / length (String on stack)
      SP - 1 = source addr (String on stack)
      SP     = target addr of String variable

      move String from stack to target addr
      actual length of String must be less or equal than Maxlength of target (!)
      pop 3 stack items
      RT Error "Undefined String", if length in SP - 1 (links) is not minus 1
      RT Error "Stringsize", if actual length of source String > Maxlength of target

   if n < 0:

      SP - 2 = -1 / length (String on stack)
      SP - 1 = source addr (String on stack)
      SP     = target addr of String representation

      move "String on stack" representation to memory (8 bytes)
      used to support call by reference (const parameter) for String expressions
      pop 3 stack items
      push target addr of String representation
      RT Error "Undefined String", if length in SP - 1 (links) is not minus 1

----------------------------------------------------------------------

VSM = Set Maxlength on String

Format: VSM n

n = maxLength of Target

Stack contains address of String variable

VSM sets Maxlength of target to n

(used before addr is passed as var parameter to procedure)

the stack remains unchanged

----------------------------------------------------------------------

VC1 = Convert 1 Char to String

implements function STR for a single char

Stack contains single char

VC1 pops char and builds String on stack

SP - 1 := -1 / length = 1
SP     := addr des Strings (alloc aus StringArea) / aus einzelnem char

----------------------------------------------------------------------

VC2 = Convert Char Array to String

implements function STR for a char array

Stack contains addr of char array
length is parameter of VC2 instruction

VC2 pops addr of char array
and builds String on stack

if length on VC2 instruction is zero, no char array addr
is popped from stack (the stack is unchanged in this case).
VC2 0 simply builds a zero length string on the stack.

SP - 1 := -1 / length = L
SP     := addr des Strings (alloc aus StringArea) / aus char array

----------------------------------------------------------------------

VCC = Concat Strings

Stack contains two Strings

SP - 3 = -1 / length 2
SP - 2 = addr des Strings 2
SP - 1 = -1 / length 1
SP     = addr des Strings 1

VCC concats the two Strings, yielding new String (new alloc)
pops two items

RT Error "Undefined String", if lengths in SP - 1 or SP - 3
(left half) are not minus 1

SP - 1 := -1 / length 1 + length 2
SP     := addr of new (concat) String

----------------------------------------------------------------------

VMV = Move String to Char Array

Stack contains String and address of char array
parameter of VMV instruction is size of char array

SP - 2 = addr of target String variable
SP - 1 = -1 / length of "String in stack"
SP     = addr of "String in stack"

RT Error "Stringsize", if length of String > size of char array

set target char array to blanks
move length bytes from "String in stack" to char array
pop three items from stack

----------------------------------------------------------------------

VPU = Push String Workarea location

VPU saves the String workarea location used until now,
so that VPO later can reset it to that point, freeing
used workarea space this way.

There are two types of VPU, VPU 1 and VPU 2.

VPU 1 needs to be done before the first occurence of one of the
P-Codes VC1, VC2 or VCC in one statement, because these three
P-Codes allocate storage from the String workarea (subject to
changes in the future !!). VPO 1 is done at the end of the statement
and resets the workarea pointer to the value it had at the beginning
of the statement.

Exception: if the statement is an assignment to the function
result in a string type function, no VPU 1 and VPO 2 must be generated
(because the function result lives in the string workarea
and must not be freed until return from the function).

In this case, a VPU 2 is generated at the beginning of the function,
which saves the current workarea pointer. This pointer is restored
before every assignment to the function result, using an instruction
VPO 2. So multiple assignments to the function result do no harm;
they all will use the same workare pointer, which is not freed until
the calling statement (containing the function call) terminates.

As it turns out, the value for VPU 1 (reset by every VPO 1) only
changes, when there are assignments to the function result variable,
handled by VPU 2 and VPO 2. So, to speed up things, I did the
following:

When entering the body of a function or procedure, one or two
fullwords are reserved for this string workarea handling. One,
if the function does not have a string result, and two otherwise.
Let's call these two fullwords VPS1 and VPS2.

VPS1 is set initially with the current string workarea pointer,
and VPS2, too (if VPS2 exists, that is, if the function has a
string result).

Every statement that uses the string workarea (for example,
by generating P-Codes VC1, VC2 or VCC, or by calling a string
function), resets the string workarea pointer at the end, by
reloading it from VPS1.

Exception: if the statement is inside a function with a string
result and does an assignment to the string result variable,
then the string workarea may not be freed. In this case, the
base address of the string workarea has been reset on entry of
this statement (to the value in VPS2), but at the end of this
statement, the string workarea content must be preserved, so
VPS1 is now set to the new string workarea content. This is
different from what happens after "normal" statements.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

VPO = Pop String Workarea location

VPO restores the String workarea location to the value
last saved by VPU, freeing used workarea space this way.

VPO must be scheduled at the end of a statement, if VPU has
been generated earlier in this statement due to the presence
of VC1, VC2 or VCC or function calls, involving a STRING result.
